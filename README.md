Hello everyone, 
I made this page while I was learning JS. This page has various feature like add income or expense. Today i.e 30-05-2020, i haven't added the deletion feature yet.

Contibution: 
If you wish to contribute in this mini-project in any form like CSS or JS feel free to fork  and pull request. I will review and add them if they are suitable.
If you are good with CSS, try to improve the list style. If you are good in JS, feel free to try to implementation in a better way if you can.

Peace!

The deletion in both the lists is working as expected. The UI is also working in co-ordination with the JS.

Features: 
1. Add any number of incomes and expenses.
2. Budget Calculation live
3. Allows to remove elements from the lists.
4. Clean design
